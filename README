Description:
  Enables a dragon model to traverse an environment in a Lorentz Attractor path. Fireballs are generated and traverse a path different from that 
of the dragon for better appearance of the dragon's flight. Light effects have been added. Four environments have been included via skyboxes.
A particle engine simulator has been used to simulate the fire-breathing action of the dragon. The particle engine is aligned and moved as per 
the dragon's the flight action. The fire has been modelled as realistically as possible in a "spreading-out" style. Similarly, snow-storm and 
rain have been simluated using modified versions of the particle engine. 
  
To execute after compiling:   
  ./CSCI5229Project    dragon.obj    size of dragon(0 to 1)

Key bindings:
    l/L        Toggle lighting on/off
    f/F        Toggle flight/static mode
    e/E        Toggle surrounding environment(Fire environment/Snow environment)  
    g/G        Fireballs ON/OFF (Fireballs appear only if dragon is in fly mode and the first environment ie. the red one)
    t/T        Dragon breathe fire ON/OFF (Fire Breathe can be activated only in fly mode)
    h/H        Snow ON/OFF
    r/R        Rain ON/OFF 
    a          Toggle axes
    arrows     Change view angle
    PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
    0          Reset view angle
    ESC        Exit

Additional Information:
   For visually pleasing appearance, please view the dragon in fly mode as follows:
       1. Fire-breathe effect in first environment
       2. Snow-simulation in second and third environment
       3. Rain-simulation in the fourth environment
   The environment numbers can be viewed at the bottom of the screen.
